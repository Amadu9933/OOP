What is OOP?
OOP or object-oriented programming is a computer science model that revolves around the use of objects as basic entities in a program. The aim of OOP is that the data should not be accessible from outside the designated functions and also to reduce redundant or duplicate codes and provide an easy to use and simple interface for the users. OOP consists of Object, Class, Methods, and the 4 pillars of OOP.

Object: An object is used to represent a real-life entity and it can be anything like a car, person, employee, or something abstract that contains certain properties and functions.
Class: Class is the blueprint through which objects are created. They define the structure and functions of the objects. The class allows the creation of multiple objects of the same type without the need to repeat code.
Method: A method is a collection of lines of code that perform a specific task. This could be as simple as printing to the console or performing complex calculations. They allow the reusability of code and save time.
